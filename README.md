Project: Module 2 Exam.

This readme contains everything related to the project. Let's go through it step by step.

html: This contains all the code. As you can see, it includes the images, the information, everything.

style: This file contains everything related to the CSS: colors, sizes, typography, 
spacing, everything. At this time, we haven't been able to implement responsiveness due to lack of time, 
as we lost time working on the header and positioning.

img: This contains all the images used to flesh out the page.
